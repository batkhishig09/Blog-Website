##Day 1
 Implemented Vite + React Js + Tailwind in front end also installed few packages such as React Router, React Icons.
 Big life saver was Flowbite React which is UI Component library. Using Flowbite React library, I was able to implement Navigation bar,
 form, search bar, and buttons very easily. Also it is user friendly and easy to modify the size by TailwindCss

 Implemented Express Js, MongoDB in back end and also installed few packages such as Nodemon.
 I finished the part about user modal via MongoDb. Adding controller.js as async function and connect it to the routes is more clean
 way to write backend code. Signing up and authorization part is working with bscryptjs (password is hashed) and you can see it on 
 MongoDB database.
 Also Middleware error handle was implemented so in that way you can debug and track your code more efficently. 

 Jumped back to the front end. Navigation bar is done. all routes of front end works fine. Search bar doesn't work but will get it done 
 after Redux toolkit is implemented. Signing up section is in progress. There is little bug when it gets seen by big screen, Sign Up form
 look small. And it is not connected to the backend yet.
